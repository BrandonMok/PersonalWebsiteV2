                    <p class="heading">Realtor Website - Group</p>
                    <p>Based on the Web and Mobile II course, 
                        groups of 4 members were given the task to create
                        a project based on an informative topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My group didn't have a specific idea, but one 
                        member mentioned that his mother, a home realtor,
                        was wanting a personal business website. 
                        With no previous ideas, we all agreed on the idea as
                        we further thought that it would be an interesting
                        experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I acted as team leader as I held meetings, communicated daily
                        with updates and requirements, and distributed tasks. I made sure
                        that each task would be completed by a certain date as I checked-up
                        on everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides watching over the group, I also made several pages and layouts
                        to contribute to the progress of the project. I further combined everyone's 
                        code so that it was a fully functional product. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We faced a big problem during the project, however, as one group member's attitude changed
                        towards the end of the project. They didn't fulfill their responsibities
                        like they stated, and waited until the last few hours until the due date to fulfill their part.
                        The resulting solution was to quickly communicate with the member while they worked: not the best solution, but
                        was successful while other previous actions and solutions failed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result of the obstacle, the appearance of the project failed to meet our expectations as the lacking member was responsible
                        for the header, footer, database, and parts of CSS. That being said, previous versions before the member's
                        part, appeared well and professional.
                    </p>
